Overview
For a computer program to be “real”, it has to be available - these days, that means deployed to the cloud. But what is the cloud, and what does it mean to build and deploy something to it? We’ll learn that and more in this sprint.

Web Application Development with Flask
What is a web application? It’s a pretty overloaded term, but in general, refers to any sort of useful interactive tool you can load in a web browser. In this module, we’ll break down the specific components of a web application, and learn how to develop our own basic web application using the Flask Python framework.

Consuming Data from an API
An easy but powerful way to make a web application interesting is to connect it to a web API - a service (that you may need to sign up for) that accepts requests and returns results, just like the servers you can build with Flask. What makes it interesting is the results they return can have all sorts of tasty data, from weather to tweets to pictures of space to information about pokemon.

Adding Data Science to a Web Application
You have your application, you have your data - now it’s time for science! Let’s use what we’ve learned throughout the program to add some useful intelligent functionality to our web application.

Web Application Deployment
You’ve put together a nice application - time to get it out there! A GitHub repo is great, but a deployed application is more effective in your portfolio as everyone in the hiring process (not just technical people) can check it out.

Resource - Git for Build Sprint
To prepare for the projects you will work on in Labs, the Labs Team has assembled an excellent guide.
