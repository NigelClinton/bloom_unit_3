## INSTRUCTIONS ##

# Load the data (use pandas) from the provided file buddymove_holidayiq.csv (the BuddyMove Data Set) - you should have 249 rows, 7 columns, and no missing values. 
# The data reflects the number of place reviews by given users across a variety of categories (sports, parks, malls, etc.).

# Using the standard sqlite3 module:

# Open a connection to a new (blank) database file buddymove_holidayiq.sqlite3
# Use df.to_sql (documentation) to insert the data into a new table review in the SQLite3 database

# Then write the following queries (also with sqlite3) to test:
# Count how many rows you have - it should be 249!
# How many users who reviewed at least 100 Nature in the category also reviewed at least 100 in the Shopping category?
# Stretch Goal What are the average number of reviews for each category?

# Your code (to reproduce all above steps) should be saved in buddymove_holidayiq.py.
# When you submit your files to Canvas you should upload queries.py, buddymove_holidayiq.py, and buddymove_holidayiq.sqlite3.

## QUESTIONS ##

# Do I need to do this in SQL queries? Similar to the first part of the assignment?

# How do I create a CSV into a Sqlite3 file?
    # Input the buddymove_holidayiq into a pandas DF df.to_sql
