SELECT*

#(When you use *, this will quary everything from the table and show you everthing.)

JOIN armory_weapon

#(This will show you all the armory wepons that have a relationship with the items within the armory item table)

#"Y" = Armory_weapon

SELECT*

JOIN armory_weapon as aw

#(You can use as - ___ similar to python for using abreviations)

# JOIN will only display the common between the two tables - MOST COMMON
# LEFTJOIN will show everything from the first table, and if there's no attribute from the second table it will provide a null value
# RIGHTJOIN will do ^ but for the left table vs right
# SQLight doesn't do RIGHT JOIN but if you want to get that result flip the ai_item.item_id=aw_weapon.item_ptr_id; to - aw_weapon.item_ptr_id=ai_item.item_id;
