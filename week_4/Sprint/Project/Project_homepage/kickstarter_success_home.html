                            Kickstarter campaigns make ideas into reality. It’s where creators share new visions for creative work with the communities that will come together to fund them.

                            Kickstarter launched on April 28, 2009. A lot has happened since. They became a Public Benefit Corporation to commit to their principles as much as our profits. They launched The Creative Independent to share resources and advice for all types of makers. They invited the local community into their Brooklyn headquarters with the Creators-in-Residence program. Projects won Grammys and Oscars & London’s V&A Museum curated a show about Kickstarter design projects.

                            Random forests is a supervised learning algorithm. It can be used both for classification and regression. It is also the most flexible and easy to use algorithm.

                        <p>
                            A forest is comprised of trees. It is said that the more trees it has, the more robust a forest is. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.

The funding goal is the amount of money that a creator needs to complete their project. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing. No one will be charged for a pledge towards a project unless it reaches its funding goal. This way, creators always have the budget they scoped out before moving forward. A creator is the person or team behind the project idea, working to bring it to life. Backers are folks who pledge money to join creators in bringing projects to life. Kickstarter is not a store, backers support a creative process. Rewards are a creator's chance to share a piece of their project with their backer community. Typically, these are one-of-a-kind experiences, limited editions, or copies of the creative work being produced. </div>

By not releasing funds unless a project meets its goal, this ensures that creators have enough money to do what they promised and they’re not expected to complete a project without the funds necessary to do so. This also assures backers that they’re only funding creative ideas that are set to succeed. Kickstarter has seen that having a goal to rally around creates a sense of urgency—it gets early backers personally invested in bringing on more supporters, and it makes every backer part of a community crossing the finish line together. Setting a goal and not charging backers unless the project reaches that goal also makes the process democratic. Backers have to come together to raise the amount the creator really needs.</div>
